The Object Oriented Program Analyzer Program (**OOPAP**) has two primary goals:

  1. Provide a basic system for User Fredericks to assess several quality metrics for the programs individual students.
  1. Design the system so that it can be extended based on User Fredericks’ experience.

The OOPAP shall be a software tool to calculate metrics to help User Fredericks guide student programmers by determining the characteristics of the programs they develop.  For example:

  1. LOC—a metric for the size of a program
  1. Comments—a metric for the percent of comment or commented lines
  1. Class counts—a metric for the number of classes in a program
  1. Variable counts—a metric for the number of variables in a program, class
  1. …

Therefore, these metrics may be of value to Software Engineers when they design programs and later when they seek to modify, extend, or improve them.  With the aid of these metrics, engineers and teams can identify components that are likely to have design problems and fix those problems.
